# 🚀 My Journey to Google with Ruby

## About Me
I'm Nitish, a Ruby developer with 6 years of experience, on a mission to crack Google's technical interviews. This repository documents my 6-month intensive preparation journey.

**Start Date:** November 14, 2025  
**Target:** Google Software Engineer Interview-Ready by May 2025  
**Language:** Ruby (my weapon of choice)

## Why Ruby?
After 6 years of Ruby development, I'm leveraging my expertise to solve algorithmic problems with elegant, idiomatic Ruby code. I believe mastery of one language beats mediocrity in many.
