# ==================== INTERVIEW TALKING POINTS ====================
#
# Opening (30 seconds):
# "This problem asks me to [restate problem]. Key constraints are [list constraints]."
#
# Approach Discussion (2 minutes):
# "I'm thinking of using [data structure] because [reason].
#  My approach would be: [step 1], [step 2], [step 3].
#  Time complexity would be O(?) and space O(?)."
#
# During Coding:
# "I'm initializing a hash here to store [what]..."
# "This loop iterates through [what] because [why]..."
# "I'm using .key? instead of .include? because [reason]..."
#
# After Coding:
# "Let me trace through an example: [walk through logic]"
# "Edge cases I'm handling: [list them]"
#
# If Asked "Can You Optimize?":
# "Yes, currently it's O(n²) because [reason].
#  I can optimize to O(n) by using a hash for [reason]."
#
# Q: "Why this approach over sorting?"
# A: "[Your answer with complexity comparison]"
#
# Q: "What if input is very large?"
# A: "[Discuss scalability, space trade-offs]"
